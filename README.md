# 🏓 Transcendence - Multiplayer Pong Game

Welcome to Transcendence! This is a modern take on the classic Pong game, built as a full-stack web application with real-time multiplayer support. It's the capstone project for 42 School's Common Core curriculum.

## 🎮 What is this?

Think of the classic Pong game, but supercharged! Players can compete against each other in real-time, participate in tournaments, track their stats, and customize their gaming experience. Whether you want a quick match against AI or an epic tournament with friends, we've got you covered.

## 🚀 Features

- **Multiple Game Modes**: Single player vs AI, multiplayer 1v1, and exciting 2v2 team battles
- **Tournament System**: Organize tournaments with 4, 8, or 16 players
- **Real-time Multiplayer**: Play against friends with smooth, responsive gameplay
- **User Profiles**: Create accounts, upload avatars, and manage friend lists
- **Statistics & History**: Track your wins, losses, and game history
- **Customizable Settings**: Adjust ball speed, AI difficulty, and more
- **Responsive Design**: Works great on desktop and mobile devices

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

We built this using modern web technologies:

- **Backend**: Django (Python) - Powers our API and handles all the server-side logic
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript - Clean, fast, and dependency-free
- **Database**: PostgreSQL - Reliable data storage for users and game history
- **Containerization**: Docker - Easy setup and deployment
- **Real-time Features**: WebSockets for live multiplayer action
